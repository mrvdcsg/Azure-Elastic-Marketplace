Security features including Basic Authentication and Transport Layer
Security are enabled for the free basic license level. 

What this means is that if you deploy one of these versions of the Elastic Stack, 
Basic Authentication will be enabled and configured, and if certificates are supplied 
for Elasticsearch HTTP and Transport layers, and  Kibana, <<tls, Transport Layer Security>> will be configured.

Please read the {security-blog-post}[Security for Elasticsearch is now free] blog post for more details.
